    // Planetary Classifications
    SuperJupiter       "Super-Jupiter"      // An astronomical object more massive than the planet Jupiter.
    GasGiant           "Gas giant"          // A massive planet composed primarily of hydrogen and helium.
    SuperNeptune       "Super-Neptune"      // A planet that is more massive than the planet Neptune. These planets are generally described as being around 5–7 times as large as Earth with estimated masses of 20–80 ME
    IceGiant           "Ice giant"          // A giant planet composed mainly of 'ices'—volatile substances heavier than hydrogen and helium, such as water, methane, and ammonia—as opposed to 'gas' (hydrogen and helium).
    SubNeptune         "Sub-Neptune"        // a planet with smaller radius than Neptune even though it may have a larger mass
    MiniNeptune        "Gas dwarf"          // A low-mass planet composed primarily of hydrogen and helium.
    MegaEarth          "Mega-Earth"         // Proposed neologism for a massive terrestrial exoplanet that is at least ten times the mass of Earth
    SuperEarth         "Super-Earth"        // An extrasolar planet with a mass higher than Earth's, but substantially below the mass of the Solar System's smaller gas giants Uranus and Neptune, which are 14.5 and 17.1 Earth masses respectively.
    SubEarth           "Sub-Earth"          // A classification of planets "substantially less massive" than Earth and Venus.
    EccentricJupiter   "Eccentric Jupiter"  // A gas giant that orbits its star in an eccentric orbit.
    HotJupiter         "Hot Jupiter"        // A class of extrasolar planets whose characteristics are similar to Jupiter, but that have high surface temperatures because they orbit very close—between approximately 0.015 and 0.5 AU (2.2×106 and 74.8×106 km)—to their parent stars, whereas Jupiter orbits its parent star (the Sun) at 5.2 AU (780×106 km), causing low surface temperatures.
    HotNeptune         "Hoptune"            // An extrasolar planet in an orbit close to its star (normally less than one astronomical unit away), with a mass similar to that of Uranus or Neptune.
    Carbonia           "Carbon planet"      // A theoretical terrestrial planet that composed primarily of graphite, diamond or moissanite could form if protoplanetary discs are carbon-rich and oxygen-poor.
    Chthonia           "Helium planet"      // A theoretical planet that may form via mass loss from a low-mass white dwarf. Helium planets are predicted to have roughly the same diameter as hydrogen–helium planets of the same mass.
    Hycean             "Hycean planet"      // A hypothetical type of habitable planet described as a hot, water-covered planet with a hydrogen-rich atmosphere.
    IceWorld           "Ice planet"         // A theoretical planet with an icy surface and consists of a global cryosphere.
    Ferria             "Iron planet"        // A theoretical planet that consists primarily of an iron-rich core with little or no mantle.
    LavaPlanet         "Lava planet"        // A theoretical terrestrial planet with a surface mostly or entirely covered by molten lava.
    Oceania            "Ocean planet"       // A theoretical planet which has a substantial fraction of its mass made of water.
    SilicatePlanet     "Silicate planet"    // A terrestrial planet that is composed primarily of silicate rocks. All four inner planets in the Solar System are silicon-based.
    Terra              "Terrestrial planet" // Also known as a telluric planet or rocky planet. A planet that is composed primarily of carbonaceous or silicate rocks or metals.
